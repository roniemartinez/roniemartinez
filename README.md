# Hi, I’m Ronie 👋

I’m a software developer from the Philippines 🇵🇭, currently living in the United Kingdom 🇬🇧.

### My Journey 🌍
- Philippines ➡️ Germany ➡️ United Kingdom

### What I Do 💻

I work on a variety of software engineering projects, including open-source libraries, tools, and more. Here’s a breakdown of my contributions:

#### 🐍 **Python Libraries**
- **[latex2mathml](https://github.com/roniemartinez/latex2mathml)**: A pure Python library for converting LaTeX to MathML.
- **[amortization](https://github.com/roniemartinez/amortization)**: A Python library for calculating amortizations and generating schedules.
- **[browsers](https://github.com/roniemartinez/browsers)**: A Python library to detect and launch browsers.

#### 💻 **Qt/C++ Plugin**
- **[libqpsd](https://github.com/roniemartinez/libqpsd)**: A Photoshop (PSD) and Photoshop Big (PSB) plugin for Qt/C++.

#### 🚀 **Rust Projects**
- **[Pulsars](https://github.com/roniemartinez/pulsars)**: A Tauri-based spreadsheet that I started writing in Rust. I’m really loving the language!

#### 🌐 **JavaScript Projects**
- **[tauri-plugin-htmx](https://github.com/roniemartinez/tauri-plugin-htmx)**: A Tauri plugin for integrating [htmx](https://htmx.org/) functionality into Tauri apps, enabling modern web behaviors without heavy front-end frameworks.

### My Other Interests ✍️
- I write a [software engineering blog](https://ron.sh/) where I share insights and thoughts on tech, tools, and the software development world.
- I actively roam around GitHub, writing bug reports and creating pull requests for libraries that I use in my day-to-day work. ❤️

### Sponsors
My open-source work is motivated by the incredible support I receive from my sponsors. If you want to support my projects and help keep me motivated, consider buying me a coffee or becoming a sponsor.
